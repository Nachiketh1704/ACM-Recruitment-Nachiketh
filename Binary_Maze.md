# Binary Maze Challenge:
# Logical Gates Room:
- 1100101011110010<sub>2</sub> AND 1010110010101101<sub>2</sub> gives 1000100010100000<sub>2</sub>
- 1100101011110010<sub>2</sub> OR 0111001100110011<sub>2</sub> gives 1111101110110011<sub>2</sub>
- 1100101011110010<sub>2</sub> XOR 1101110111001110<sub>2</sub> gives 0010011001010101<sub>2</sub>
- NOT 0010011001010101<sub>2</sub> gives 1101100110101010<sub>2</sub>
# Binary Convertion Room:
1101100110101010<sub>2</sub> gives 56042<sub>10</sub>
- Adding 123: 56165
- Multiplying with 7: 393155
- Converting back to binary: 11000000001000010011<sub>2</sub>
# Weighted Binary Balancing: 
On converting the binary value to decimal values, we get the following:
9, 12, 14, 10, 7, 5, 3, 15, 13, 11, 6, 4, 2, 1.
From these, we can see that the largest number id 15 so we need 16 which in binary is 10000<sub>2</sub>
# Binary Tree Navigation: 
The path is as follows:
- Root → Left (1)
- Left → Right (0)
- Right → Left (1)
- Left → Right (1)
- Right → Left (1)
# Binary Sequence Game:
After examining the sequence, here are the moves:
- Flip bits at positions [2, 4, 6] to get: 11111111010100101110
- Flip bits at positions [10, 12, 14] to get: 11111111111111101110
- Flip bits at positions [16, 18, 20] to get: 11111111111111111111
Result: It takes 3 moves to make all bits 1.
# Binary Palindromes:
- The number is not a palindrome because the reverse of 1011011101 is 1011101101, which does not match the original.
- Only one bit needs to be flipped at position 6 (0-based index). Change the 1 to a 0 to make it a palindrome.
- Transformed binary number: 1011101101
# Complex Binary Patterns: 
1111000000 = 960
1110100000 = 928
1110010000 = 912
1110001000 = 904
1110000100 = 900
1110000010 = 898
1110000001 = 897
1101100000 = 864
# Binary XOR Pairs With Constraints:
Maximum XOR Pair: The maximum XOR result is between 101010 and 011011, giving the result 110001.
# Binary Multilples and Remainders: 
- Conversion: 1101010 in binary is 106 in decimal.
- Check multiple of 7: 106 ÷ 7 = 15 remainder 1. Since there is a remainder, 1101010 is not a multiple of 7.
# Final Answer: 
- From the previous binary number, 1101010, the decimal value is 106. 
- Multiplying with 5: 530
Final Answer is 530
